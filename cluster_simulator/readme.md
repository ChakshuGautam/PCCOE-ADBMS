A cluster simulator for the PCCOE ADBMS course. It should be able to simulate the following:
- Creation of a cluster
- Creating a node in a cluster; Add/subtract nodes from a cluster;
- Connect nodes in a cluster through a network
- Creation of a file in a node
- Creation of a directory in a node

The focus of this simulator is to understand how a cluster works. Build a database on top of it using the concepts of distributed database.
